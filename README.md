# The purpose of TABOHAE Project

> To enhance our coding skills of Python

Nowadays, we have hard time to getting better grades and higher specs. As a result, we gradually forget what is really important. We just writting a meaningless biography of ourselves which is not we really want. Therefore, we think that we have opportunities to do what we really want, though we can do this only when we are in university. The HABOHAE Project was started with these ideas. We are small study group in Haedal Programming, the programming club in KNU(Kyunpook National University) located in Daegu, Republic of Korea. Please encourage us growing to professional developer and engineer. Thank you.
