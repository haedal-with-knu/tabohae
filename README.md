# The purpose of TABOHAE Project

> To enhance our coding skills of Python

Nowadays, we have hard time to getting better grades and higher specs. As a result, we gradually forget what is really important. We just writting a meaningless biography of ourselves which is not we really want. Therefore, we think that we have opportunities to do what we really want, though we can do this only when we are in university. The HABOHAE Project was started with these ideas. We are small study group in Haedal Programming, the programming club in KNU(Kyunpook National University) located in Daegu, Republic of Korea. Please encourage us growing to professional developer and engineer. Thank you.

개발자가 입력하는 명령어를 string으로 받는 함수   
>입력형식
>
>   sys.argv[int]
>-------------------------------------------------
>사용방법   
>1. import sys ( sys 모듈을 import 해줍니다.)   
>2. sys.argv[n] ( int형의 순서 n을 넣어줍니다.)   
>-------------------------------------------------
>Ex> 명령창에서 python d:\argvTest.py arg1 arg2 를 입력하면  
>   argv[0] value = argvTest (파일이름;디폴트값)  
>   argv[1] value = arg1  
>   argv[2] value = arg2
